It groups \"unlabelled\" data with its own properties which are decided by the model. Since the clustering is unsupervised learning, the data gonna automatically be grouped by the model.\n\nFor example, when we provide pictures of fruits that contain apple, banana, and orange, the clustering model groups them with three labels defined with their properties like colors, shapes, or something we don't know.\n\n\n\nK-means clustering is one of the most popular clustering model in machine learning. K-means clustering is the machine learning model that divides unlabelled data sets into $K$ number of clusters. We'll set the number $K$ which is the number of centroids in the dataset.\n\n![kmeans.png](kmeans.png)\n\nLike the above image, we define the $K$ to 3, then the model divides data into three clusters.\n\n### The Elbow Method\n\nThe elbow method is a function to find an optimal $K$ in a K-menas clustering. It uses WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Square) funtion which find the sum of the squre distance between points in a cluster and the cluster centroid.\n\n$$\nWCSS=\\sum_{P_i\\ in\\ Cluster 1} distance(P_i, C_1)^2 + \\sum_{P_i\\ in\\ Cluster 2} distance(P_i, C_2)^2 + \\ldots\n$$\n\n## Actual Example\n\nWe gonna deep dive into the realistic example with the dataset of customers of mall. The input dataset is the information of 200 customers of the mall which contains Genre, Age, Annual Income, and Spending score. The spending score ranges between 1 to 100 that implies how customers spend on the mall.\n\n#### Importing the libraries\n\n```{python}\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n```\n\n#### Importing the dataset\n\n```{python}\ndataset = pd.read_csv('../dataset/Mall_Customers.csv')\ndataset\n```\n\n```{python}\nX = dataset.iloc[:, [3, 4]].values\n```\n\nNow, we gonna use only annual income and spending score of the dataset. Since we would build 2D clustering graph, we only use these two variables to X.\n\n#### Using Elbow Function\n\n```{python}\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\n\nwcss = []\nfor i in range(1, 11):\n    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters = i, init = 'k-means++', random_state = 42)\n    kmeans.fit(X)\n    wcss.append(kmeans.inertia_)\nplt.plot(range(1, 11), wcss)\nplt.title('The Elbow Method')\nplt.xlabel('Number of clusters')\nplt.ylabel('WCSS')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn the previous elbow method graph, there is a point where the graph rapidly changes from it. It is called \"Elbow Point.\" The number of clusters from the elbow point will be the $K$ number.\n\nIn this example, the $K$ is 5. \n\n#### Training the K-means model\n\n```{python}\nkmeans = KMeans(n_clusters = 5, init = 'k-means++', random_state = 42)\ny = kmeans.fit_predict(X)\n```\n\n#### Visualising the results\n\n```{python}\nplt.scatter(X[y == 0, 0], X[y == 0, 1], s = 100, c = 'red', label = 'Cluster 1')\nplt.scatter(X[y == 1, 0], X[y == 1, 1], s = 100, c = 'blue', label = 'Cluster 2')\nplt.scatter(X[y == 2, 0], X[y == 2, 1], s = 100, c = 'green', label = 'Cluster 3')\nplt.scatter(X[y == 3, 0], X[y == 3, 1], s = 100, c = 'cyan', label = 'Cluster 4')\nplt.scatter(X[y == 4, 0], X[y == 4, 1], s = 100, c = 'magenta', label = 'Cluster 5')\nplt.scatter(kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 0], kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 1], s = 300, c = 'yellow', label = 'Centroids')\nplt.title('Clusters of customers')\nplt.xlabel('Annual Income (k$)')\nplt.ylabel('Spending Score (1-100)')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\n\nAs shown above, we successfully group unlabelled dataset into five clusters. Each cluster is divided with its own color. The big yellow points in the graph are centroids of each clusters.\n\nBy running K-means clustering model, we can group customers into five different clusters. The manager of mall can use this information for whom they want to target.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\nClustering Model is one of the unsupervised machine learning model.
